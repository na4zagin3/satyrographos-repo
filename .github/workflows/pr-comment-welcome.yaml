            üéâüéâüéâ Thank you for sending a PR!

            If this PR is to add new or updated SATySFi libraries, I would like you to include your new library in the package snapshots, by following the instructions below.

            After the CI passes, choose ‚Äúautomatic follow-up‚Äù options to add your libraries to add snapshots.
            Please leave a comment in case you don't want.

            **Notes:** I recommend adding your libraries to the snapshot with the latest develop version as well
            if your library supports the latest stable version,
            because the snapshot with the latest develop version will be the snapshot with the the comming SATySFi stable version.

            Thanks!
            `
